* Typescript, Angular 2 intro app 
* Initial reaction:
* Not as different from NG1 as I thought
* Hardest part is learning Typescript, not Angular 2 itself
* Boy is this templating syntax goofy
* Not having $scope should make things much simpler
* Will web components ever take off?  If so, Angular 2 will be unstoppable. If not, who knows?
